## My Story

I take pride in the fact my pursuit of excellence has shaped my career.

At my last role, over the course of the 5+ years I spent with Eaze, I climbed the ladder from a basic CS Agent
to a custom role of QA Analyst. This was through demonstrating the ability to effectively
identify problems and create solutions utilizing the resources available to the team.

Let me give you an example: The first thing I ever built for Eaze was the calculator that CS used for product-related cannabis taxes. 
Sure, it was a Frankenstein of Excel functions with an hourly imported file (from a simple SQL query). It worked though, and for my
entire tenure with the company we would utilize it. They may still be using some of my creations now!

Some of my additional achievements include:

- Developed, maintained, and optimized dashboards and reporting tools, aligning with QMS standards, to provide critical insights into customer experience, product performance, and business operations, supporting strategic decision-making.
- Created a comprehensive handbook wiki for all customer service agents, outlining common scenarios and response expectations, facilitating standardized and effective customer interactions.
- Established monthly audit processes for product and customer service issues, enhancing the team's ability to identify and address areas for improvement.
- Designed detailed database schemas for tracking product-related issues, significantly improving the resolution process and overall customer service efficiency.
- Generated brand-specific monthly reports, providing partners with valuable insights into trending issues and fostering transparency.
- Collaborated with the Trust and Safety team to develop processes for identifying and investigating potential fraudulent activities, enhancing the company's security measures.
- Developed and maintained a custom Zendesk email tagging system, streamlining communication and enhancing the efficiency of customer support teams.

These contributions were made while adeptly managing the challenges of a remote work environment, showcasing strong adaptability and self-motivation.
