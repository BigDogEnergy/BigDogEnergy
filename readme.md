Hey there, and welcome to the next step of my adventure -- and this time i'll be learning Software Engineering!

## My Story

I have been self-taught my entire life, and have always pursued new challenges in the roles I have taken on.
At my last role, over the course of the 5+ years I spent with Eaze, I climbed the ladder from a basic CS Agent
to a custom role of Quality Improvement Specialist. How did I manage it? By demonstrating the ability to problem solve 
using a limited amount of tools and resources. 

The first thing I ever built for Eaze was the calculator that CS used for product-related cannabis taxes. Thinking about it now, 
it was really just a Frankenstein of Excel functions with an hourly imported file (from a simple SQL query) through Mode Analytics.
I'd definitely build it different now, haha.

Some of my additional achievements include:

- Created and maintained a custom Zendesk email tagging system, including funnels for teams.
- Created and maintained a handbook for all CS agents based on common scenarios
- Created and maintained the processes for CS to perform monthly audits for product refunds. 
- Designed and developed comprehensive database schemas for product-related issues, facilitating enhanced issue tracking and resolution by the customer service team.
- Created brand-specific monthly reports to ensure our partners knew of any trending issues
- Assisted in the creation of processes with the Trust and Safety team to identify and investigate potential Fraudulent acitivity

& all of these things were completed while working in a remote setting.
