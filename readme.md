## My Story

I take pride in the fact my pursuit of excellence has shaped my career.

At my last role, over the course of the 5+ years I spent with Eaze, I climbed the ladder from a basic CS Agent
to a custom role of Quality Improvement Specialist. This was through demonstrating the ability to effectively
identify problems and create solutions utilizing the resources available to the team.

Let me give you an example: The first thing I ever built for Eaze was the calculator that CS used for product-related cannabis taxes. 
Sure, it was a Frankenstein of Excel functions with an hourly imported file (from a simple SQL query). It worked though, and for my
entire tenure with the company we would utilize it. They may still be using some of my creations now!

Some of my additional achievements include:

- Created and maintained a custom Zendesk email tagging system, including funnels for teams.
- Created and maintained a handbook wiki for all CS agents based on all common scenarios and what expectations were for their response.
- Created and maintained the processes for CS to perform monthly audits for product and customer service issues. 
- Designed and developed comprehensive database schemas for product-related issues, facilitating enhanced issue tracking and resolution by the customer service team.
- Created brand-specific monthly reports to ensure our partners knew of any trending issues
- Assisted in the creation of processes with the Trust and Safety team to identify and investigate potential Fraudulent acitivity

& all of these things were completed while working in a remote setting.
