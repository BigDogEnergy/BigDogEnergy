## Let's get the important thing out the way first. This is Beau:

He has two assistants (my cats). Ask me for photos of them!

## Things Beau would be proud of me for:

### Most recently
- Became hired as the primary Front End Engineer after my first internship for a large community-management platform. I have since began ramping up on the difficulty of tasks and have been an active member with planning new features and gameplans for their implementation.

### In my previous roles
- Developed, maintained, and optimized dashboards and reporting tools, aligning with QMS standards, to provide critical insights into customer experience, product performance, and business operations, supporting strategic decision-making.
- Created a comprehensive handbook wiki for all customer service agents, outlining common scenarios and response expectations, facilitating standardized and effective customer interactions.
- Established monthly audit processes for product and customer service issues, enhancing the team's ability to identify and address areas for improvement.
- Designed detailed database schemas for tracking product-related issues, significantly improving the resolution process and overall customer service efficiency.
- Generated brand-specific monthly reports, providing partners with valuable insights into trending issues and fostering transparency.
- Collaborated with the Trust and Safety team to develop processes for identifying and investigating potential fraudulent activities, enhancing the company's security measures.
- Developed and maintained a custom Zendesk email tagging system, streamlining communication and enhancing the efficiency of customer support teams.

These contributions were made while adeptly managing the challenges of a remote work environment, showcasing my strong adaptability and self-motivation. Plus Beau hates when I am not home to be his private chef, personal assistant, and caretaker.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I like to ride my Onewheel on the beach during low tides. It's best done when the sunset matches the timing. You can do so because the sand is just compact enough from the excess moisture.
